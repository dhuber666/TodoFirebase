### Practicing Project with Firebase & React

Project can be viewed here: https://todo-d045a.firebaseapp.com/

#### Features:

* Real Time Database Sync with Firebase
* Everything you would expect from a simple Todo App (Toggle, filter, deleting. etc...)

It uses React and Firebase for Front and Backend. 
The styling comes almost purely from Googles Materialize CSS. 

The app doesn't features Redux.
